[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Ed-Fi-Admin-Console-Shared-SDK/badge)](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Ed-Fi-Admin-Console-Shared-SDK)

# RELEASES
* Commits to the main branch (only allowed via PR) will produce a release
* Commits to a branch prefixed with *pre-release/* will also, but be sure to tag the version in the package.json so that the "release" is easily noted as un-official (-alpha, -beta, -SNAPSHOT etc)

## Contributing

The Ed-Fi Alliance welcomes code contributions from the community. Please read
the [Ed-Fi Contribution
Guidelines](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/display/ETKB/Code+Contribution+Guidelines)
for detailed information on how to contribute source code.

Looking for an easy way to get started? Search for tickets with label
"up-for-grabs" in [Tracker](https://tracker.ed-fi.org/issues/?filter=14106);
these are nice-to-have but low priority tickets that should not require in-depth
knowledge of the code base and architecture.
